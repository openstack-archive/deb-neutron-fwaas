class FwaasDriverBase(object):
    """Firewall as a Service Driver base class.

    Using FwaasDriver Class, an instance of L3 perimeter Firewall
    can be created. The firewall co-exists with the L3 agent.

    One instance is created for each tenant. One firewall policy
    is associated with each tenant (in the Havana release).

    The Firewall can be visualized as having two zones (in Havana
    release), trusted and untrusted.

    All the 'internal' interfaces of Neutron Router is treated as trusted. The
    interface connected to 'external network' is treated as untrusted.

    The policy is applied on traffic ingressing/egressing interfaces on
    the trusted zone. This implies that policy will be applied for traffic
    passing from
        - trusted to untrusted zones
        - untrusted to trusted zones
        - trusted to trusted zones

    Policy WILL NOT be applied for traffic from untrusted to untrusted zones.
    This is not a problem in Havana release as there is only one interface
    connected to external network.

    Since the policy is applied on the internal interfaces, the traffic
    will be not be NATed to floating IP. For incoming traffic, the
    traffic will get NATed to internal IP address before it hits
    the firewall rules. So, while writing the rules, care should be
    taken if using rules based on floating IP.

    The firewall rule addition/deletion/insertion/update are done by the
    management console. When the policy is sent to the driver, the complete
    policy is sent and the whole policy has to be applied atomically. The
    firewall rules will not get updated individually. This is to avoid problems
    related to out-of-order notifications or inconsistent behaviour by partial
    application of rules. Argument agent_mode indicates the l3 agent in DVR or
    DVR_SNAT or LEGACY mode.
